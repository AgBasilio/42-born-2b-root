Port 68/UDP is used by the DHCP client to receive IP address configuration from a DHCP server (usually during boot or when acquiring an IP).
    * UDP port 67 → used by the DHCP server
    * UDP port 68 → used by the DHCP client (your machine)
The machine is listening for DHCP replies from the server.
UFW rules apply after the packet reaches the network stack, but some traffic like DHCP is considered local/system-level and is usually allowed implicitly — especially:
    * Outbound-initiated replies (like DHCP, DNS)
    * Local services needed for basic network functioning
Port 68 is not listening in the conventional sense of accepting arbitrary connections — it's waiting for solicited replies. (It's not an open inbound port in the sense that a remote host can just connect to it.)
UFW's "deny (incoming)" still blocks unsolicited incoming packets — replies to things like DHCP or DNS are state-tracked and allowed.
